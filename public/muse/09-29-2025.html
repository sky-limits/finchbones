<p class="griditem2 aside">I will use this: <a href="https://wrender.neocities.org/tarotinstructions">site</a> to pull my cards from.</p>
<div class="griditem3 aside"> <p>First pull: Judgement. Second pull: Reversed 10 of Pentacles. Third pull: King of Cups.</p></div>
<div class="griditem4">
  <p>Reflection. Reckoning. Awakening. Avoid drowning out your emotions. Huge financial losses.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge it, this I know. I am going to lose something here, and there is no running away from that.</p>
