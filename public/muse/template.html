<p class="griditem2 aside">Inspired by a trip to the library of Fonmon castle, this layout is inspired by the large collection of 18th century volumes there. Designed around an asymmetric five column grid, the first and last columns are two hundred pixels wide. The centre three are ninety six pixels wide each. The gutters are thirty pixels. The centre three columns can be combined to one master column – like the one you’re now reading.</p>
