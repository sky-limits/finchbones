            <p>Bundled</p>

<p> Fog gathering in<br>
 Bundling senses within<br>
 Hiding it from me. <br>
 <br>
 Veins<br>
 The rolling in of the clouds called me<br>
 It hummed and danced around me<br>
 And I knew deep down I was gone.<br>
 But the swirling, towering, twirling,<br>
 Traipsing, trailing mist hung heavy <br>
 In my heart - <br>
 It filled my veins -<br>
 My mind was painted with the simple, <br>
 Shifting colors of the fog, and <br>
 I was back.<br>
 <br>
 Asking<br>
 Shining, piercing, cyan neon <br>
 Bright bright light filled my body.<br>
 There was nothing left in me<br>
 But<br>
 A gentle, soft, invisible, <br>
 Almost soundless little whisper.<br>
 &quot;Why?&quot; <br>
 A screech filled my ears, I threw my arms up-<br>
 I attempted to hold my breath in, not let<br>
 The sound hold me captive. <br>
 <br>
 Sound<br>
 Cold ice filled my lungs,<br>
 Surrounded by darkness as I reawoke <br>
 And the eyes closing in on me <br>
 Echoed,<br>
 Left behind,<br>
 The eyes in my mind. That<br>
 Howling<br>
 Whipping<br>
 Screaming<br>
 Sound that had reverberated into my soul.</p>

<p> ??.<br>
 A black shape filled my vision as I grew<br>
 Coherent?<br>
 Mindful?<br>
 Scared. <br>
 The blood boiling sound came into my world again<br>
 Deep breath, I told myself. <br>
 There were no words.<br>
 It was <br>
 Static?<br>
 White noise?<br>
 Feral.<br>
 I had been changed by this shape, <br>
 My original form lost behind in,<br>
 In swirling threads and wisps of whispers.<br>
 Form?<br>
 Body?<br>
 Gone.</p>

<p>
 Breath<br>
 This was it, <br>
 The last step,<br>
 The strangest one.<br>
 Breathe in, breathe out.<br>
 I was watched,<br>
 Held pinned under,<br>
 Water filling lungs.<br>
 Breathe in, breathe out.<br>
 The other - esk,<br>
 Stood over me,<br>
 Eyes shredding soul.<br>
 Breathe in, breathe out.<br>
 I suffocated there,<br>
 My last night,<br>
 Heart stopped completely. <br>
 Breathe out.</p>
