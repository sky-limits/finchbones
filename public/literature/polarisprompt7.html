            <p>I have been this way for a long time. It has seemed endless, this new form, fused into my mind as the only thing I have ever been. My before life is nothing but an imagining, a hazy and fogged-over reflection of a dream half-remembered, but I cling onto it, as I cling to the power I have now. New ideas, abilities, knowledge, have graced this form. I float, like the albatross over the ocean wind currents, I fall into strange rooms of an unforeseen place, darkened and lit only by shimmering, shivering stars, the honeycombed glass walls resounding with the sound of the waves that lapped at the edges of a lonely black rock.</p>

<p>But as of now, I exist in my tangible dream home, the only part of reality I can touch and feel. The stonework of the walls falls apart more with every passing year, and the buildings in the city over the horizon grow taller. I sit and watch them, sometimes, the humans working like ants to build something that will never really matter, in the end. It will never last, just as my cottage did. It didn&rsquo;t outlast me, with its creaking doors and patched thatched roof, cracked shutters, and rotting doorframes. I had outlasted the only person that ever mattered to me, and now I was alone, alone without her hazy dreaming figure, fuzzy coppery hair frilling around her face when she beamed, a smile that outshone the sun.</p>

<p>I knew she loved the forest, how the sunlight dapped the mosses underneath the canopy, where it brushed sparkling things buried in the underbrush, and how it played down the crescents of falling water from little creeks and streams covered by ferns on the banks. She harvested mushrooms from fallen logs, gently cutting away at their stems and placing them in a basket to eat later. She appreciated how the forest floor sprang back after winter, leaves defrosting and sprouts unfurling their small hands to capture the sunlight in their palms and drink its nurturing energy.</p>

<p>I looked towards the woods that sat only a few long strides away from this old hearth and home and decided to make a new trip. The water at the base of the cliffs crashed as I stepped away, cymbals calling angrily for me to return, but I instead kept walking. The rickety and rotting old pier was nearly engulfed by the high tide, barnacles, and other small life forms struggling to hang on, to hold close to their pilings. Angrily thrashing, the water seemed to want to reach out and grab me, like it didn&rsquo;t want me to leave. But I passed the bank, and it calmed, instead of slipping slowly further and further back down the shoreline. It looked...hurt. Hurt as water could be. So, I spared a final glance and walked into the woods.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, the flower on my chest blinked out of existence, light leaving it and bathing me in darkness as my guiding lantern&rsquo;s glow also disappeared. I was suffocating on the choking shadows that filled the gaps in between the trees, looking for a way out, help, light, anything that was something I could hold onto, a lifeline to rescue me from here. I stumbled, blind, through the forest, seeking the sound of flowing fresh water, the sound of home, and what was familiar. The sun sent searching tendrils through the canopy, and I dashed for the light, curling into myself in the small glade, shuddering with fear.</p>

<p>The dark had been all-consuming, like a hungry mouth with an endless appetite. This was nothing like the forest the sun-haired woman had loved, nothing at all. I felt weak, small, the anger and righteous justice that usually fueled me had sapped away. I was a husk, a wooden bowl full of dried flower petals, filled with nothing but air, regret, and death. I shivered with cold, laying there in the glimmering golden beams, and heard nothing. The forest, for all the life the copper-haired woman had said, lived here, was dead. No birds sung their merry tunes as they built homes, no frogs chirping and toads beating away on drums. The orchestral accompaniment of the life in this biome had gone missing, and only I was left.</p>

<p>Slowly, I stood. My legs wobbled underneath me, unsteady, not yet ready to leave the recovery of the glade and its soft grasses. But I knew this wasn&rsquo;t a place for me, wasn&rsquo;t where I was meant to be, nor where I belonged. By now, I was able to see deeper into the forest, my eyes adjusted and all right. I felt better, like I understood my purpose here now, and knew where I belonged.</p>

<p>So once again, I dove deeper into the trees. They accepted me in with short thickets, tangling in the low-hanging strands of my tail as it dragged behind me, following me through the shadowy thick of trees. I knew there was something deeper to this forest, to these woods beside my home, and I pressed on, attempting to find the calling voice that hummed deep inside me. I wandered through shade, through dappled shimmers of light, through dry creek beds and pebbled banks.</p>

<p>Still, I was called, and still, I moved forward. I was tangled, fur matted with burrs and covered in speckles of mud as it had clung to me through my trek. Finally, I reached an end to my journey. I was right back at the start, at the edge of the woods, not yet granted back my light. I turned my head, looking deeper to the forest. Why had it sent me back? Why was something calling me back to my home? I had originally been called out to the forest, out of curiosity, out of grief...out of longing? Longing for someone I no longer knew or remembered. I recalled her face in deep flashes of a semblance of sleep, her laugh in the sounds of cooing doves flying by, her hands, cradling mine, when I brush past a fern, or a moss.</p>

<p>I bent my head, bidding the forest goodbye, and step out. I am back in the place where I belong, and my light has returned. The invisible heaviness of the lantern on my back weighs me down, and the flower on my chest lights the way, like a searchlight, pointing me forward. I follow where I am lead, and I come to a tomb, cracked with age, lichens growing in the stone. A rosebush blooms around the headstone, thorns embracing the unreadable name and date left, eroded by the rain and weather. I know this is where I am supposed to be, and so I stay. I lay down, curling myself, and stay there, growing smaller and smaller, with a loss I don&rsquo;t understand consuming me.</p>
