        <center><h1>polmeanes' storm</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>Vultuulf stretched her limbs, shaking out the long, webbed paws at the end of her legs.<br>
            Rain had been battering her and her companions since the dawn, and the white stripe trailing<br>
            down her back acted like a lightning strike of attention - it seemed like most of the rain fell on<br>
            her, and only her.<br>
            She shook her head, creating her own private rain shower, and listened to the<br>
            instructions being given by the lead rexal. Three teams would head out: the strongest to pull<br>
            the ships further inland, away from the fog; cunning to retrieve lost inventory and make it back<br>
            to shore safely, and fast, fast enough to swim through ripping currents and guide ships and<br>
            their passengers to shore.<br>
            Vultuulf called out when the team being chosen to pull ships was mentioned. I'm strong,<br>
            she mused, following a squadron to the ships and grabbing one of the ropes.<br>
            The rain and wind didn't make it any easier to see what she was doing, as she tied the<br>
            rope neatly in front of her shoulders, tugging on the knot and hoping it was secure - hoping<br>
            she wouldn't trip and stumble into the muddy shores of the island while trying to help.<br>
            The fog had been encroaching fast when she and her fellow Dome dwellers were called<br>
            to the Posian Islands, to assist them in their plight. Much help was needed as the storm<br>
            developed, and the thoughts brewed in Vultuulf 's mind like the storm clouds on the horizon.<br>
            Muscles straining, she pulled the ship forward, away from the dangerously soupy fog. This fog<br>
            had been here before she was born, and it would continue to be. Another step in the sand,<br>
            leading her forward, sharp claws digging in for purchase, steps syncing to her fellows.<br>
            This fog threatened the islands - untie yourself, dash to the next ship, a great and<br>
            mighty beast, nearly swallowed by the fog, tie yourself and pull - and the livelihoods of the<br>
            rexes on them.<br>
            The third ship is the one to get Vultuulf, bringing her blue shoulders crashing into the<br>
            sand as her rope suddenly loosens. Spitting the gritty grains of sand from between her gums,<br>
            she stands again, and grips the frayed end of the rope between her teeth this time, closing her<br>
            eyes against the strain it creates and pulling with all her might.<br>
            Others around her fell in similar measure and time, like an invisible hand keeping tempo<br>
            to sweep them all over. In reality, the storm was worsening, and it was nigh impossible to defeat<br>
            the deafening scream of the wind - even the rain that battered down on scales and fur alike was<br>
            louder than the rushing blood in ones&rsquo; ears.<br>
            The fog crept ever closer, seeping in like water under a door you thought was sealed<br>
            tight. It was a malevolent entity, omnipresent, neverending, and it seemed like it got closer to<br>
            the shore the more ships Vultuulf and her team pulled to the shore.<br>
            Further down, towards already emptied shells of buildings, the fog curled and snuck, a<br>
            lithe claw of it hoping to latch onto the furthest ship. Her masts were in danger of the fog<br>
            touching them, but so far she rocked in the water unscathed. Someone on Vultuulf &rsquo;s team<br>
            called out, a thing near to a scream, and they ran to the ship, tying themselves with haste.<br>
            As they pulled, the fog pulled harder, and touched the very edge of the wooden<br>
            planking. Vultuulf watched as puller after puller bit through or unraveled themselves from the<br>
            rope otherwise, dashing away as the fog seemed to climb up even faster around the ship&rsquo;s body,<br>
            ever hungrier as it had finally found something to consume.<br>
            Vultuulf nosed her way out of the rope that bound her to the ship, turning away from<br>
            the doomed ship. There would be nothing left to save now - she just had to hope it was<br>
            abandoned, like the town the fog was rolling towards.<br>
            She could do nothing but go to the next ship, pull it onto the sand, and then the<br>
            next&#8230;and the next&#8230;and the next. Eventually, the ships seemed safer than they had before, or at<br>
            least safe enough to deem leaving for the time being, Vultuulf and her group gathering back at<br>
            the unofficial meeting place, awaiting instruction and hoping the next task might be easier.<br>
            Instead, it was more ships to pull, smaller longboats and other attachments to the main<br>
            ships. These still held cargo, so one rex from the group was assigned to swim behind the boats,<br>
            helping to keep them even - and rescuing any wayward packages, should they happen to take a<br>
            tumble.<br>
            Vultuulf was assigned to take the task of swimming. Oh Elders&#8230;<br>
            She hated the way water felt in her fur; even if it was minimal compared to some Rexals&rsquo;<br>
            lavish hairstyles, it still felt like it dragged her down and made her heavier than usual.<br>
            Regardless, she padded into the water and pressed her forehead against the hull of the<br>
            raft. It was easy going at first; with the rain beating down and simply swimming along behind<br>
            the raft - then they hit the land, Vultuulf &rsquo;s feet catching on the lip of the start of shore.<br>
            The raft&rsquo;s bow hits too, bumping the sandbar and swaying side to side for a moment<br>
            before it steadies, packages sliding dangerously to port and starboard before their brown paper<br>
            wrapping settles, sitting quietly once again.<br>
            Sand scrapes underfoot, scratching the hull and leaving shards of roosting barnacles on<br>
            the beach, shed from the raft as it is pulled fully ashore. Vultuulf pants, head hanging down and<br>
            resting on the aft of the small boat. The next fleet of rafts await, calling to the shore with<br>
            wooden creaks as they bob like unbothered seabirds on the rough waves.<br>
            The rexal shivers, cold wind picking up and cutting through her entire body. Even the<br>
            keratinous armor on her throat felt cold to the touch, the rounded edges almost like sharp<br>
            knives as she trod to the next launching point. The team moved in huddles from boat to boat;<br>
            crowded together like they could defeat the wind in a Roman platoon, though it was futile at<br>
            holding in any warmth - the boats continued down the shore, flocked together and drifting;<br>
            how could they ever rescue them all?</p> </div>
