        <center><h1>the purple mare</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>After their day of play and discovery of the great tree, the herd took the night to rest. The night so far had been quiet, uneventful. Sheltered under the branches of the giant pine, Sicil and her herd were well-protected - not a worry existed in her mind as she settled down with Cinder and Dove - she rested easily throughout the evening, a dreamless sleep that took her under like a strong current in the wine-dark sea.</p>

            <p>She slept, until a gentle movement outside of the shelter of the pine thrust consciousness upon her. Her ears flicked forward, pupils dilated and eyes wide as she tried to decode the noise. Fear struck her heart until, through the needles of the tree, she saw something unlike she had ever seen in all of her years.</p>
            
            <p>Sicil had seen blights, terrifying creatures that murdered and tore and rent her life apart, but she had never seen the likes of the creature in front of her now; the graceful body of a unicorn like herself, but something within that spoke volumes to chapters of life Sicil would never be privy to. This unicorn had seen magic, breathed it and bled it and known it as intimately as one would know their lovers.</p>
            
            <p>Her purple coat shimmered underneath the sky&rsquo;s dancing lights, and a singular horn - more like a crest - stood tall and proud, arcing over her flowing, curling mane. The other mare looked towards the sky and spoke softly to herself, tilting her body to observe the lights in such a way that they highlighted the white patches mottled over her entire body.</p>
            
            <p>
            Sicil knew she had to speak to this other. But how? Probably slowly&#8230;don&rsquo;t want to spook her. Emerging from the branches quietly, so as not to scare the mare, Sicil hummed quietly and announced her presence, introducing herself: &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she smiled, and waved her tail lazily through the now-falling snow. &ldquo;I'm Sicil&#8230;what brings you here?&rdquo; The mare whipped her head around to look at this new stranger, but did not open her mouth to speak.</p>
            
            <p>
            Sicil loved the way snow crunched under her hooves as moved a little closer to the mare, taking a chance to look up at the lights herself. &ldquo;They're quite beautiful, aren't they? I don't really know what they are, but I suppose there's something of magic about them, don't you think?&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>With a smooth, steady movement, Sicil laid down to look at the lights, and with a pleasant smile, murmured, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me sitting here,&rdquo; and looking from the lights back to the mare, she continued: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just entrancing. I can&rsquo;t help but want to get a better look.&rdquo;</p></div>
