        <center><h1>big ol tree</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>Snow fell deep on the ground, in drifts and dashes and dribbles along rocks still hot from the morning sun. Sicil, Cinder, and Dove all walked along the well-beaten trail of the woods, a train of unicorns. Sicil and Cinder walked alongside one another as Cinder ran ahead, dashing into snow banks and crashing through frozen bushes.</p>

            <p>
            &ldquo;I wish I had her energy,&rdquo; Dove mumbled under his breath, dragging a hoof through the muddy dirt. &ldquo;Look at her run around, like it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>
            Sicil chuckled, nudging the stallion with her shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re silly, old man. I think the cold is just making your old bones grumpy. Why don&rsquo;t you come ahead with us and see what she&rsquo;s looking at?&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>While they had been talking, the little black filly had paused in the middle of the trail, head cocked to the side and ears pinned forward - listening, watching. Sicil picked up into a trot, quickly catching up to Cinder. &ldquo;What do you see, little one?&rdquo; Cinder stamped her hooves and huffed out a little cloud of breath, then pushed her nose forwards.</p>
            
            <p>
            &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she whispered, eyes wide as dinner plates. Sicil looked - just as Dove arrived behind the two of them - and saw exactly what had surprised the foal so much.</p>
            
            <p>
            In front of them was a giant pine tree, its green needles stark against the birch forest they had been strolling in. The very tips of the tree seemed to sway and brush against the sky itself, raking through the clouds like they were nothing more than a suggestion. The pinecones from the tree were huge as well, as large as two of Cinder, and after getting over her initial shock, she squealed and ran forward, rearing up and stomping on one of the smaller pinecones.</p>
            
            <p>
            The shards of cone flew around like a cloud of sparks, and Cinder laughed raucously. Dove and Sicil exchanged a look, and then went forward to the tree. It didn&rsquo;t seem threatening, so they started to play with the pinecones too - kicking them back and forth, while Cinder chewed on one of the smaller ones, breaking off pieces and spitting them out like sunflower seeds.</p>
            
            <p>
            Eventually, night fell around the great evergreen tree, and though it was snowing once again, the space below the tree was warm and dry. Dove, Cinder, and Sicil, exhausted from their day of play around the wondrous tree, decide to rest and spend the night under its branches.</p> </div>
