          <div class="div"> <p>[M-E] Brambles<br>
            Brahim Zafar 253<br>
            Bashir 592<br>
            It was empty in the forest that afternoon, the sound of birdsong almost absent as<br>
            Brahim walked alongside his pony, Bashir. The duo were quiet as they made their way through<br>
            the brush, the grullo pony and human searching for something neither entirely knew. Well, the<br>
            man knew in a sort of way - they were searching for a mage. This search had led them from<br>
            highlands to steppes, to deserts and valleys, and finally, to this forest.<br>
            The search was not going to end here, Brahim sensed. Following clues and small trails<br>
            that he wasn&rsquo;t even sure of had left him exhausted, ragged, missing his family. But still, every<br>
            day he rose before the sun, the same routine he had followed for his entire life. He stretches,<br>
            packs up camp - sharpens his sword and cleans it - then feeds everyone and goes on. They've<br>
            been doing this for months now, Bashir and him, and have seemingly made no progress. It<br>
            could crush a person; being this alone for this long, and all of it being his fault, but Brahim was<br>
            not the sort of man to crumble.<br>
            Today, he holds the small horse his daughter made him, clutching it gently in his hands<br>
            and running his thumb over the folds in the paper, crinkles and creases he knows by memory<br>
            from how long he has had the small toy. He walks next to Bashir, the gear shared equally<br>
            between the pony and himself, giving his mount a break as they walk uphill, along a winding<br>
            path through the trees. There is not much to be seen in terms of noteworthy appearance - not<br>
            many animals seem to call this place home, and the mage, if she had come this way, had covered<br>
            her tracks well.<br>
            Soon however, if his rudimentary map is to be trusted, they will come to the very top of<br>
            the hillside, where Brahim should be able to gain a larger vantage point. But for now, they hike<br>
            together, man and beast side by side, each focused on making their own way up without falling<br>
            on the other. Halfway up, Brahim leans an elbow on the back of Bashir, catching his breath for<br>
            a moment, mumbling something about needing to get to the top before sunset.<br>
            The broad-shouldered man walks with a walking stick in his hand - just a large branch<br>
            found on the ground - and his sword bumps against his hip as he goes, cloak flapping with<br>
            every step. He turns his head to Bashir, and begins to talk to him properly this time, to have<br>
            some sort of company in the quiet wilderness. &quot;So, a long trail ahead of us, huh boy?&quot; The pony<br>
            huffed, seemingly agreeing with the little whickers he made as they walked. &quot;I wonder what will<br>
            be at the top...&quot; Brahim put away the origami horse, and brushed a hand through his thick dark<br>
            hair, the recent greying stripes making him sigh whenever he saw his reflection.<br>
            But there was no time to worry about how age affected him - he had to find that young<br>
            mage, bring her back...get his family back, even at the sacrifice of another. He sets his jaw and<br>
            continues, reaching the top of the hill in record time, Bashir always at his side; keeping step<br>
            with him.<br>
            Finally, the duo stare out at the rolling hills underneath them, and Brahim looks back<br>
            down the trail they have come from. His small campsite from last night's rest is still visible,<br>
            albeit looking like a smudge on the green grass. He rests a hand on the neck of his pony, both<br>
            taking another few minutes to catch their breaths. Then he stands up straighter, and sweeps the<br>
            land below with his gaze.<br>
            They have been following clues and tips from small villages and passersby, but who even<br>
            knows if their words have been truth? Regardless, Brahim and Bashir have continued, and now<br>
            they have to head north, where the last set of clues have led. It's time to pick their way down<br>
            the other side of the hill, time to continue along their way to find the young mage.<br>
            This time, Brahim climbs aboard Bashir, ruffling his fingers through the pony's dark<br>
            mane comfortingly. It would make more sense to not lead him down the hill - if his surefooted<br>
            horse managed to slip somehow, it would take Brahim tumbling too. So, they moved smoothly<br>
            down the hill together, Bashir picking his way over rocks and pebbles, until they encountered a<br>
            roadblock. Here, Brahim dismounted, and took the reins over Bashir&rsquo;s head, leading him<br>
            closer. They were finally on flatter ground, and the man stood, surveying the thicket of thorns<br>
            that held them from continuing. He considered his sword - hand resting on the hilt, thinking<br>
            about slicing through the brambles. But no, this would take too long, and potentially damage<br>
            the blade itself, as the thicket grew wide and close together. Brahim turned his head to look to<br>
            the side, where the path ended and tall grasses grew, without the brambles.<br>
            What a way to continue along their journey. With another sigh, he swung his leg over<br>
            into the saddle again, clicking his tongue so that Bashir would begin walking. Brahim carefully<br>
            threaded the two of them through the thorns and around, avoiding any major scratches on his<br>
            legs. Still, some of the fabric of his pants caught, and he had to stop several times to unwind<br>
            himself.<br>
            It was slow going, but they finally broke through, and were back on their way.<br>
            Traveling to the north, against the light of the sun setting to the west, casting their shadows<br>
            long and lean on the ground. Bashir started walking forward, without Brahim needing to utter<br>
            a noise. Soon, if they were lucky, they&rsquo;d happen upon someone else who had seen the object of<br>
            their quest. For now? They had to scout the horizon in front of them.<br>
            As Bashir clipped to a trot, Brahim rummaged in the bag hanging on the saddle,<br>
            catching deftly in his hands the map which another man in a tavern had scribbled out for him<br>
            for a small fee. Even through his steed&rsquo;s jittery pace, he could make out the lines of the map,<br>
            tracing it gently with his hands. Over the rise of the hill, along the flatter plains to the north,<br>
            and eventually coming to a mountain range.<br>
            He had overheard traders in the marketplaces of little towns along his way speaking<br>
            about a young girl, traveling all alone, with a hand that sparked with magic if someone looked<br>
            her way too long. Talked to some of them privately, asked what she had bought - jerky, warm<br>
            clothing, blankets. A knife. Wherever she was going, Brahim had to guess it was going to be<br>
            cold, and it was going to be dangerous.<br>
            As he folded the map, he took the reins up in his hands again, and shaded his eyes to<br>
            better see the land in front of them - the bright bloody glow of the setting sun made it difficult<br>
            to see, but he could make out the mountain range in the distance, faded into the sky as it was.<br>
            He nudged his heels into Bashirs&rsquo; sides, whistled a long, high sound, and the pony started<br>
            galloping, taking Brahim closer and closer to what could hopefully be the end of his journey.</p> </div>
