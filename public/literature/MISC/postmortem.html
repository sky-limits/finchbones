        <center><h1>a letter, postmortem</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>I watched you bleed out your last breaths on that floor, don&rsquo;t you know? I watched you die, and it stuck with me this long, for it to become the only thing I tried to remember about you. I tried to remember nothing but the last look you gave me, so I could mourn you like a normal man - like just another soldier, another friend, another traveling companion lost once they had seen the wrong side of war.</p>

            <p> I never asked to be this way. I never asked for you to make me feel more of it, after I had tried to press it down so hard, tried to ignore it for so many years. I ignored it for more years than you ever lived, and you still brought it out in me somehow. The way you&rsquo;d stare at me when we walked across the desert, waiting for me to look over so you could blow your cigarette smoke into my face with a cheeky grin. The way your back pressed to mine when we were surrounded. The way you held your cups, a little too tight, like they were going to run away from you. <br>
             <br>
             The way you grabbed my hand as you died, like I was going to run away from you.</p>
            
            <p> It&rsquo;s been months now, and I&rsquo;m slamming back shot after shot, trying to forget you. But I see you in everything that I look at, in every ghost of someone who&rsquo;s died because of me. I was never such a heavy drinker. Maybe you gave that to me too, because you were never fully sober, not even on Sundays.</p>
            
            <p> Thinking about you hurts, so I leave the bar, and tuck my hands in my coat pockets, looking for someplace to go. The girls left me a few days after your funeral - exchanging sad looks with each other, and then with me. Meryl and Millie were comfortable with who they were, and left holding hands.</p>
            
            <p> I found nothing as I walked drunkenly through the streets, swaying side to side. This is where my long red duster coat came in handy, leaving a sidewinders&rsquo; trail in the dirt as I stepped. Maybe I could find my way back in the morning.</p>
            
            <p> Instead of finding a half decent motel (or just a shitty one) I found myself an open, abandoned crop field to lay in. Spread-eagled, staring up at the stars. You were never a man for the heavens, but I know you saw them not only in the skies, but also in me. It makes me grit my teeth, the fist at the end of my metal arm. I hated how you wanted to love me. I wanted it too - knew it every time you said my name, so casually - &ldquo;Vash!&rdquo; calling me without a care, saying my name like it was all you knew.</p>
            
            <p> As I lay there, thinking about you, I think more and more on what I should&rsquo;ve done. I should&rsquo;ve held you, pressed a kiss to you for the first time, whispered that I loved you, as much as I hated myself for it. But I didn&rsquo;t have any love left for myself, so I had nothing to spare for you, not even in death. Not even in prayers to a god I knew wasn&rsquo;t out there, just like you did. Once you were gone, you were gone - so I rolled over in the dirt of that field and slept, hoping that it would be easier in daylight.</p>
            
            <p> <br>
             It wasn&rsquo;t, it never was, and I felt your absence like a hole in my chest, a hand digging deep, clutching at my heart and lungs and pulling them down into the nothingness that you fell into on that church floor. I liked to think you held the Punisher because it gave you comfort, reminded you of the cross on the wall, let you be just that little bit closer to your iconography, enough to give you the comfort you needed to confess. <br>
             <br>
             And I knew you had been confessing, breathing out slow and deep all your sins while you were finally, blissfully alone. I saw it when I held you cradled across my lap when you wheezed, how your lips were slick with blood and spit, chapped like you had been licking at them. I see you every day when someone licks their lips in a bar or on the street, remembering your bad habits - your chewed nails, bitten lips and bedraggled hair when you were woken too early.</p>
            
            <p> No one had instilled this hate of you and what you meant in me besides myself, besides the observations of humans I had made when I had first come here. Not all of them were so unkind, so cruel. But so many of them were that it changed me. I think if we had had more time, I could&rsquo;ve loved you.</p>
            
            <p>
             I can only hope, in your death, somewhere - if you are anywhere - that you hear me. That I&rsquo;ll stop seeing you everywhere in the little actions other people take, in the familiar way I turn to look at you when I have a glass to clink against someone else's.</p>
            
            <p>
            Maybe one day I can forget you, if I&rsquo;m lucky. <br>
