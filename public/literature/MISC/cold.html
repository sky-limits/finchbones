        <center><h1>cold from the sky</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>The first time she ever saw snow&#8230;it wasn&rsquo;t hard to recall. She was just a hatchling,<br>
            armored throat still soft, furred back still downy. Her parents hadn&rsquo;t quite been prepared for<br>
            the snow; after all, it was the beginning of spring when their daughter hatched - but nature (or<br>
            the Elders) had other plans.<br>
            Outside, Minnuette was digging, chubby paws scooping handfuls of earth, and setting<br>
            them carefully to the side. Once she had a pile probably about the size of her head, she began<br>
            to delicately pick apart the dirt. Well, she tried to be delicate. Untangling roots and brushing<br>
            away pebbles, Minnuette unearthed worms, to her great delight.<br>
            They were put aside in a bucket filled with more dirt, and the young rexal went back to<br>
            her scoop, organize, pick apart actions. The wind picked up while she did, and there was a<br>
            strange smell on the air, one that she couldn&rsquo;t identify - a little like rain, and a little like dirt.<br>
            She tilted her head to the sky, closing her eyes and trying to focus on the smell, when<br>
            she felt it. A cold, almost burning sensation, right on the tip of her delicate snout. Minuette<br>
            yelped, and a little spark of her pink magic burst out, knocking her back onto her haunches.<br>
            She swatted at her nose with a dirt-stained paw, but the feeling had already disappeared.<br>
            However, her paw came away the slightest bit wet&#8230;she wrinkled her nose at the strange<br>
            series of events, and thought nothing of it until, a few heartbeats later, the feeling returned,<br>
            this time on her tail. Minuette was lucky enough to see it happen, a small white spot landing on<br>
            her and disappearing within the blink of an eye.<br>
            &ldquo;Just what is this stuff?&rdquo; Minuette caught a few particles in her paws, then watched as it<br>
            fell from the dome&rsquo;s sky a bit faster now, coming down in drizzles and beginning to cover the<br>
            ground quickly. While the first few moments of it melted as soon as it hit the grass, it soon<br>
            began to stick easily to itself.<br>
            Minuette was not a short baby; she could easily clamber on top of her parents&rsquo; backs<br>
            when she wanted to wake them up for something exciting. But the drifts of the powdery white<br>
            substance soon came up to cover the apertures on her front legs, and she squeaked with<br>
            concern, barreling towards her home and safety from the snow.<br>
            Fear was stronger than curiosity, and soon the drizzle began to slow to a simple flurry,<br>
            summoning the young rexal back outdoors. She set a paw on the surface outside the door, and<br>
            almost immediately, it began to crumble under her weight. Minuette withdrew her paw, tilting<br>
            her head curiously at the surface and blinking, then lowering her nose and taking in a long<br>
            breath. It just smelled&#8230;cold. Finally, Minuette stood back up to her full height and considered<br>
            the land covered in the soft, white stuff - her parents had told her it was called snow - and she<br>
            took a grand, large leap out into it.<br>
            She sunk into the snow and it was so, so cold - but still, it was fun to run through it,<br>
            barreling around and making trails through the snow, large drifts of it building up in her wake<br>
            and flying into the air as she kicked around.<br>
            Minuette put her nose into the snow and watched as it melted around the warmth of her<br>
            breaths, steam puffing out into the empty space and spiraling up into the air around her.<br>
            Standing on her back feet for a moment, wobbling and almost losing her balance, she then falls<br>
            backwards, wiggling around on her back in the snow. Front arms spread out, Minuette left<br>
            imprints of her body in the snow, giggling all the while.<br>
            She soon discovered that it was especially fun to pounce into the snow, her back feet<br>
            launching her into the snowbanks and piles of it, exploding the powdery top layer and spraying<br>
            it out into the air. More than a few times, she popped out of a snowbank with the top of her<br>
            head covered in a little hat of the stuff.<br>
            Soon though, she was being called inside - her fur was cold and wet, and stuck to her<br>
            like a too-tight jacket. The sun was setting far too quickly for her preference, and she dashed<br>
            inside as soon as she was called, wanting to get warm. Tucked in, enjoying the warmth of a fire,<br>
            Minuette settled into sleep, tuckered out from her day of play.</p> </div>
