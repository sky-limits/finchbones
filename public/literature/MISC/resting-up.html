        <center><h1>resting up</h1></center>
       
        <p>Sicil accepts that the stallion doesn't want her to simply stand around and talk to him - tired, and pink like a rose, he&rsquo;s probably too sunburnt to think. Instead, she bows her legs and lays down next to him, grabbing some nearby moss, now soaked with the twilight dew.</p>

        <p>Offering it to him, her mouth full, she nods at his sunburns. &ldquo;Put &lsquo;is on &lsquo;em,&rdquo; is her muffled plea, and laying them next to the white stallions legs, she beckons Cinder. &ldquo;Come along, little one. It's past time we rest.&rdquo; Turning her head back to the stallion, Sicil smiles and scoots herself a comfortable - but not far distance from the stallion, and Cinder lays alongside her flank.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry to interrupt your rest, sir,&rdquo; is how she starts, &ldquo;I know you must be quite tired from the day. But the plant is cold; it'll help your sunburn if you put it on your nose.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>The stallion does so, sighing with relief when the coolness of the moss meets his burnt skin.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I'm sorry I can't do more,&rdquo; Sicil apologizes, &ldquo;I don't know all of the herbs around here. However,&rdquo; musing, she flicks her ears at the forest, listening to the rustling of trees. &ldquo;If you came along with me and the little one here, we could help keep you safe? In the shade? Plus, I know there must be a herb in the woods for those burns; they just don't grow near the shore.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Sicil huffs tiredly, and then smiles at the stallion. &ldquo;But, I know you're tired, and my speech probably isn't helping anything. My offer - to join my herd, just me and Cinder here - to help you find something for your nose is open, all you have to do is say something.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Then lowering her head, Sicil watches Cinder with interest; the little foal pricks her ears and swivels them like a bat, but her adoptive mother can see that the foal has begun to take long, sleepy blinks. &ldquo;Shall we go bed down for the night?&rdquo; Sicil asks softly, nibbling a burr out of Cinder's mane. &ldquo;That way we have lots of energy for fun tomorrow, right?&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Cinder thought this over for a moment, little tail flicking from side to side. &ldquo;No&#8230;&rdquo; she pouted, &ldquo;I don't want to sleep yet! We've barely gotten to have any fun!!&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Blowing air from her nose gently, Sicil chuckles and pulls Cinder closer into her body, sending a last friendly, open look to the stallion. As Cinder falls asleep at the mare's side, Social opens her mouth to murmur one thing more: &ldquo;I hope you don't mind us spending the night here,&rdquo; and tucking her tail over the foal, finishes her sentence. &ldquo;Maybe we can help you, and you can join us, after we all get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
