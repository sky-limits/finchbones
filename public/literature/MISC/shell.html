        <center><h1>shell</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>Atronia woke with a start - to a great clanging outside of her den. Stretching, she yawns with a small growl, and pushes her head through the hide flap. In the courtyard of her home, her master sits, sorting out various pieces of shiny items.</p>

            <p>She approaches him, stalking him on feather-light pawpads. &ldquo;Good morning, Attie.&rdquo; The Nemeion can hear the smile in his voice, and flattens her ears against her fluffy head. Drat. Still, she comes to sit next to him, licking his hair into a cowlick on her way past as revenge. Sighing, her owner attempts to settle his hair back into something reasonable, but gives up after only a few minutes. &ldquo;Attie,&rdquo; he scowls for a moment at the lion in front of him, leisurely licking a large cream paw. Then he smiles. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t need a bath.&rdquo;<br>
            Atronia huffs out a little laugh, and rests her head on her feet, watching. Belts and buckles are pulled through glinting metal, and the lion tilts her head. A strange contraption. Almost if he can hear her thoughts, her owner - Marlin - looks up from his work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s armor, Attie. It&rsquo;s gonna help you win in the Coliseum.&rdquo; Attie mumbles out a growl, just as acknowledgement. &ldquo;I know you don't like it,&rdquo; he mumurs, still working, &ldquo;but it's good for you. You have so much energy!&rdquo;<br>
            Atronia rolls her eyes, but doesn't have any other noises to make in return. Marlin soon finishes with the armor, stepping back with a happy sigh. He looks up at his Nemeion, her black eyebrows pulling together in apprehension. &ldquo;Ready to try it on?&rdquo; Atronia stands, and allows Marlin to saddle her with the armor, muscles tight and unsure.<br>
            The armor is&#8230;heavy. Uncomfortable, choking at her throat. The leather straps digging into her sides make her wince, and Atronia growls, afraid.<br>
            Walking around to her face, Marlin's eyes appear in her vision, and they're full of concern. He lays a hand on her forehead, but the already overwhelming weight of the armor, combined with the touch, causes her to take out a nip at Marlin's hand.<br>
            Gasping, he stumbled back, and Atronia runs back into her den, tearing and ripping at the leather straps, pulling off the armor on the way. From behind her, she hears Marlin. &ldquo;Attie! Attie, I'm sorry, are you okay? Attie!&rdquo; He's standing outside her den, not daring to move the hide aside. The amor lays askew across her floor, glinting evilly in the dim light.<br>
            A loud growl answers Marlin's queries, and he steps away quickly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighs. &ldquo;I'm not going to fix this in one day.&rdquo;<br>
            Her owner walks away, and Atronia listens to his fading footsteps. Left to stare at the armor on her floor until she falls asleep, her mind fills with nightmares of being trapped into the suit; melded and one with it, unable to breathe.<br>
            How could she fight without armor? How could she make Marlin proud?</p>
            
            <p>In her dreams, Atronia is running around an endless ring of stone and sun warmed bricks, being chased by a Nemeion much larger than her. Their teeth bared, their claws outstretched, waiting to grab her, to rip into her, without her armor - vulnerability.</p>
            
            <p>In the waking world, Attie shuffles in her sleep, curling paws and tail and ears flicking in tandem the only signs of what was going on in her mind.<br>
            Marble encased her body, flattening her fur into clumps as she wailed, crying out for Marlin, who looked down from the emperor's booth of the Coliseum. He shook his head, voice booming like a god: &ldquo;What could I do with a Nemeion who's too scared to wear armor?&rdquo; Atronia yowled, long and keening, until the stone filled her mouth and covered her eyes.<br>
            Awake again. The lion wakes up to his voice. &ldquo;Attie,&rdquo; he calls, soft through the hide. &ldquo;I'm sorry about yesterday.&rdquo; Brushing aside the pelt, Marlin crouches inside, a plate full of meats and just a few sweet breads - Atronia is allowed to have a little sweetbread, as a treat - balancing delicately on his hip. For just a moment, his eyes flicker down to the destroyed armor on the floor, but he quickly looks back up, meeting his Nemeion&rsquo;s eyes.<br>
            Sliding the plate across the floor, Marlin sits down, cross-legged. Gently, Atronia begins to take the food from the platter, enjoying it as she scarfs it down. Marlin says nothing, simply watching his lion eat for a bit. Soon, he speaks up, voice quiet. &ldquo;Attie, I&rsquo;ve gotten someone who can hopefully help you get over the armor. You not wearing it isn&rsquo;t an option. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>Atronia snorts. Ridiculous. Hiim, thinking he could force me into something? I&rsquo;d like to see him try.</p>
            
            <p>The crack of a whip sounds outside, like a war cry.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>Sighing, Marlin turns his head to look at Atronia, her fur standing on end over the entirety of her massive body. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Marlin attempts to reassure her, but it is futile - the lion casts him a look of disdain and fear. &ldquo;The whip is just him showing off&#8230;&rdquo;<br>
            It takes the two men thirty minutes to drag Attie from her den, and then Marlin leaves them to train. His lion watches him walking away, ears flat to her head. Betrayal. This new man, broad-shouldered and covered in scars, grins at Atronia. It comes off as more of a sneer, all teeth and growling breaths. Cracking the small whip he holds against the air, he points at the pile of armor laying nearby. Bending to her level, the trainer grins again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to wear that,&rdquo; he grabs Atronia by her dark scruff - &ldquo;And I will not be leaving until you do.&rdquo;<br>
            True to Marlin's word, the other trainer doesn't hurt her, at least not physically. But forcing her into the armor, muzzling her, pulling buckles and belts too tight, he traps Atronia within her worst nightmares.<br>
            A pressure builds within the Nemeion's chest, threatening to explode outwards as she stares down the strange man, a gilded bauble with nothing to save her. Breathing short and shallowly, Atronia shakes, plating feeling heavier and heavier as she pants.<br>
            The man cracks his whip, and Attie cringes back as best she can in the too-tight armor. I can't do this, she thinks, swallowing down the panic in her body. The longer I show him I'm scared, the longer he'll make me stay in this&#8230;thing.<br>
            When he unfurls the whip, before he even has a chance to break it against the air, Atronia lunges forward, claws outstretched and teeth bared. She doesn't intend to hurt the man, and her fake-out works. He steps back, taken aback, and after a moment of shock, he laughs, deep and guttural.<br>
            &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he chuckles, wiping tears from his face. &ldquo;I guess you have a little more fight in you than I thought!&rdquo;<br>
            Atronia growls, trying not to think too much about the armor still on her body - she's escaped this man, for now.</p> </div>
