            <center><small>an act of making yourself gentler and more palatable than you are for someone you love</small></center>
            <p>Wolfwood knew he would, most likely, never get over Vash. They sat together, they ate together. Wolfwood knew what the man sounded like when he dreamt, when he pretended to be asleep. He knew him so intimately - but Vash was not privy to the same facets of Wolfwood's life.</p>

<p>The priest was a private man. He loved his life without attention&#8230;for the most part. Mostly? He didn't want Vash to know everything he had done in his past. He grips the steering wheel of the small jalopy they found and fixed up. Meryl and Milly are asleep in the back seat, Vash taking up the front, curled into a little ball. Alone like this, or in his room - feet flat on the wooden floors, cold cold cold against the heat of the desert because of his drawn curtains - he thinks.</p>

<p>He straightens his collar, closes his eyes. In tandem with his muscle memory, he sighs and thinks. Wolfwood remembers death. He remembers back-alley stranglings in the way a normal man would recall a voice crack whilst talking to an object of affection.</p>

<p>Wolfwood remembers everyone he has ever taken a life from, counts them religiously before bed without the prayers he's supposed to be saying. And he hates the man he has made himself into, been forced into.</p>

<p>As a child, he dreamed of being a farmer. He loved to imagine children swarming him, a wife or a husband to work the fields with. Watching green shoots become taller and taller day after day, but - he blinks, a little too hard, and the fantasy of green life turns into red death, growing into long stems along a tiled floor.</p>

<p>He's been so caught up in his mind that he hasn't noticed Vash waking up, putting his prosthetic hand around Wolfwood's wrist. &ldquo;Hey. Nick.&quot; He says it so softly that the engine nearly covers up the sound of his voice. &ldquo;Take a break. Let me drive?&quot;</p>

<p>Vash is right. He's hunched over the wheel, shoulders tight and teeth set. And he looks over to respond&#8230;tried to make eye contact with Vash, with his baby-blues and gelled up hair. He can't. Giving up, Wolfwood brakes, hops out, and switches with Vash. He slides smoothly into the seat, and refuses to look over at his friend. Instead, he chooses the coward's way out, and closes his eyes again.</p>

<p>Every time he does, the past flashes up like the pop of a camera bulb, words and bodies splashing against his eyelids. &ldquo;Please don't,&quot; they mostly said. &ldquo;I have a family! Children!&quot; was another popular one. Some of them just stared up at Wolfwood, pleading, sometimes glazed over eyes. Some screamed. Some cried. A very few laughed from the pain.</p>

<p>In the end, the priest wrestled his jacket off and slung it over his face. This way, he could keep his eyes open, and pretend to be asleep. Vash drove on - over potholes and large bumps, and after a time, Wolfwood let tears fall from his eyes. He disguised sniffles and sobs behind sputters of the engine and coughs of the exhaust; until night fell.<br>

            <p>They had stopped for the night. Finally, there could be rest between the four of them, true rest, in a few rented rooms. Milly and Meryl shared, like they always did, patient mouths moving in smiles and practiced words when they said their evening farewells to the boys.</p>

<p> Nicholas laid awake for a long time. He slept in a separate bed from Vash, like they always did. There was so much distance between them like this, six inches apart on rickety rotting bedframes. There was a gap that Wolfwood could never hope to breach with the inhuman object of worship he had chosen, a distance kept at arm's length for Vash&rsquo;s own safety. For Wolfwood&rsquo;s dignity.</p>

<p> The priest sits up in bed. He could swing his legs over the side, touch Vash&rsquo;s shoulder, wake him up from the sleep which he mumbles through. He could tell him everything that he has ever done - the lives he takes because it&rsquo;s easier to do so than to talk - the sins he carries in the weight of the Punisher on his back.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s many things two men in a room together can do. Wolfwood doesn&rsquo;t know this. Wolfwood doesn&rsquo;t know anything, not as much as Vash does. Something in Vash is much, much older than Wolfwood could ever begin to imagine to be, and yet Wolfwood knows he&rsquo;s lived much more than Vash ever could. Lived in all the wrong ways, poisoning himself with alcohol and cigarettes, sleeping like a dog on the streets in his collar and suit. Learning to bite fast, first, and hard.</p>

<p>He was exceptional, beyond remarkable - Wolfwood was special to the Eye of Michael. So why couldn&rsquo;t he, in this room, in this time, look over and wake up Vash? Why can&rsquo;t he confess all he&rsquo;s done, every one of Vash&rsquo;s morals he&rsquo;s forsaken - every reason why he should walk away and stay away? When he reaches out a trembling hand, kicks his legs over the side of the bed, and stands fully over Vash&rsquo;s sleeping form, he wonders more. Why can&rsquo;t I let myself be special to Vash?</p>

<p>Because you kill. Because you maim. Because you let them change you, and you didn&rsquo;t even fight back. Because you&rsquo;re impure. Because you&rsquo;re a sinner. Because you&rsquo;ll never be able to change what you&rsquo;ve become - Wolfwood withdraws his hand, and walks out of the shared room. He shuts the door, and the rusting, sand-worn hinges squeak, but don&rsquo;t wake Vash. He&rsquo;s spent so many nights looking out across this same desert of N0-Man&rsquo;s-Land, just from different angles and viewpoints. He&rsquo;s lit the same cigarette a thousand times in the same routine.</p>

<p>Match lit, pressed to tip already held in mouth, a quick breath in and the cherry of the cigarette flares in the night. Ash sprinkles to the ground, the priest breathes out, and deftly moves the cigarette from his mouth to his hand. Maybe he could be worthy of Vash, if he changed himself.</p>

<p>Wolfwood grimaces. He can&rsquo;t change himself the way he&rsquo;s thinking of. He&rsquo;ll never be able to escape what he&rsquo;s done, so maybe he could hide from it. Maybe he could hide the way he hurts, the way he kills. Maybe he could, on the surface, be what Vash wants and needs. If he devotes every part of himself to the upkeep of the illusion, he might just be deserving.</p>

<p>He stares down at the cigarette in his hand. The first part of the illusion is giving up his sin - he puts it out with his thumb and forefinger, and heads back into the room, where Vash will never know the extent of the change he&rsquo;s pushed Wolfwood to attempt.<br>

            <center><small>love as a failing sense of self</small></center>
            <p>You taste like what the sky would, if it had a name like yours. Even the very air you breathe out, the ground you walk on, it all leaves a trace of you on every part of me. I feel you in the beat of my heart, in the steps I take following your lead.</p>

<p>I feel you as the only real part of myself that I have felt in years.</p>

<p>Loving you would be everything. Opening my mouth, finally saying the words: finally &ldquo;Did you know I love you more than I know how to breathe?&quot; Finally, &quot;I love you no matter your past.&quot; Finally &ldquo;I'll die for you every day. I'll patch you up after every stupid mistake. I'll hold your hand like you hold your weapons. I'd be your weapon, if you asked.&quot;</p>

<p>I could look at you like a million sunsets, and I'd never understand you. You're like ancient myth to me, something I have to explain in an obvious lie to convince myself to not be afraid of worshiping you.</p>

<p>I'll never be the same because of you, and sometimes I want to grab you by the shoulders and shake you, shake you so hard it rattles you and you could begin to understand the depths of what you've done to me.</p>

<p>The way I speak is the way that you breathe, the way I walk is the way that you ask me to stand next to you. You influence me like the stars do, doubled up when I'm drunk, you teach me the way my mother did when I was very very young - to love so hard it hurts no one but you, to touch like you'll forget if you don't, to want and crave and desire the world and more, to then create that world for yourself.</p>

<p>I don't think I could've created someone as perfect as you though, shaping my world as I have. I've shaped it horribly, hurtfully. I've shaped it the way I've been treated, scarred and cut-up, by myself and others. I took out on the world what it did to me, and now I'm scared - am I capable of taking my past out on you too?<br>

            <center><small>when he's there</small></center>
            <p>Every morning, Vash has started waking up with Wolfwood in the room. Sitting at the rickety motel desk, smoking. In the shower, singing. Laying in the other bed, still as a corpse.</p>

<p>He didn't ask the preacher to stay closer to him, but that didn't matter - Vash was glad for the company. One day, he awoke to see Nicholas a few inches from his face. His body took too long to react; but the other man was asleep anyway, his hooked and crooked nose almost touching Vash&rsquo;s. He breathed so softly it was like he wasn&rsquo;t breathing at all.</p>

<p>Nicholas was too, too close. Far more than Vash needed for comfort, or warmth, or whatever other excuse he could tell himself to explain the other&rsquo;s sudden change in behavior.</p>

<p>If you can touch me, you're real. I'm real.</p>

<p>I can bleed into your hands when you bandage my wounds. I can eat you alive like the sun and the moon.</p>

<p>I can weep when you die in my arms.<br>
