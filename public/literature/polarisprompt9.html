          <div>

            <p>My home is my habitat, and like the animals the people in the town keep in cages, I pace too. My head is heavy with the weight of my sorrows, and I hang low, stuck in the mire and muck that surround my boundary. The forest crowds me to the east, darkness encroaching and following me when the sun is high, allowing the shadows to reach out their bony fingers and grab at me. The village, city, whatever it classifies itself as it is now, rises, nearly towering over the mountains that ring a sleepy valley and its lake. I climb the walk up to the village on my saddest days, quietly taking in everything around me. The sun rises in the east, and the city is painted golden orange rays through the morning. Often, I amble through town at this time of day, slowly padding along as my flower and lantern disappear.</p>

            <p>Naked, classified now as wandering, I sit with the beggars on the streets, the people seeking a warm shawl or hunk of bread. I know these people, know them in my soul with deep mourning. They are simple in needs, complex in story, like me. I curl next to them, and though they cannot feel me, I know I am of comfort to them, somehow. They realize they aren&rsquo;t alone, know that while I cannot keep them warm physically, something is trying to help. I see it in their eyes, the crinkles and wrinkles and crow's feet relaxing into a comfortable, vulnerable smile. It is rare to see them like this, open to the world after it has shut them out. They inspire me, to smile with my mouthless face, to open back up to the world through my pain.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>I visit them daily, and leave my mark. When I exit the village at sundown, many of them stand together, no longer solitary and afraid of one another, but embracing and singing sweet songs, of sunny pomegranates and crystallized warm waters. I feel warm, looking back at the scene I&rsquo;ve created, inspired. These are good people, and I am lucky to be graced with their presence. Soon, my head no longer hangs low as it did. I swim in my lake for the caress of the silky water, not to lose myself in its orchestral wailing. I float, bouncing and leaping along, joyous and light. The people in the city come together to help each other, supporting everyone within their little kingdom. I&rsquo;d like to believe this is all me, but I simply know that it isn&rsquo;t. I may have contributed, but I was not the patch for their wounds, the salve for their bruises.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>By night, I stand in front of my home, hopeful, lantern swinging above me with a gentle, unseen breeze. I am ready to help travelers in need, while not able to be seen by these people, I am noticeable in some way. Some sense my energy, the humming that lives inside of me and echoes outward, reverberating through spaces around me and conforming to others&rsquo; energies around me. In the twilight blush of the sun setting over the mountains, a pair of staggering wanderers stumble through my path. One is wounded, the other holding them up, mumbling something encouraging.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>I follow them, worried, until the wounded one collapses, and the other with them. Down on their knees, the helping, weary traveler weeps into their hands. I sit on the sidelines of this interaction, and try to absorb how they feel, comfort them in this time of need. I know the injured traveler will not be getting up again. With a heavy heart, the other trembles, walks over to a patch of soft earth, and begins to dig. Their hands scrabble in the dirt, desperate for purchase, digging a hastily made grave before darkness fully sets in, envelops the world in a simple choking hold, when the predators and highwaymen come out, when someone such as a lone traveler would be in danger.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>Standing by, I watch them, unable to help. Dirt catches under their fingernails, in their hair, on their skin, until they are splotched with the effort of the labor. Soon, it is dug, through sheer force and willpower. The wounded, now still person, lies in the grave. The now lone traveler closes their eyes, and weeps, filling in the resting space of their companion quickly. The sun has now set, catscratch moon crowning the canopies of the slim-fingered trees, and now unaccompanied, the traveler leaves, quickly jogging to the city.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>For a while, I sit by the grave with my head bowed, the grief of the situation overtaking me and all the good I have done so far. I lay, gently at the head of the dirt mound, and rest with the soul now resting beneath it. It feels right, good to do, keeping them company with my lantern light and glowing petals. This person needs to be remembered, recalled by those that pass, I decide. So, I rise to my feet, and begins lifting rocks, moving them into a clumsy pile, balanced delicately on their edges and ends.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>When the morning comes, the traveler comes back, presses their palms to my cairn, and leaves again. I become sort of a myth in the city. People whisper of me in hushed tones, little messages and pipsqueaks of rumors spreading tendrils through the cracks, binding them together. Soon, more and more are buried near my home, near the lake. I build cairns for them all, the mysterious spectre with a light only glimpsed faintly in the densest of fogs. Over time, they grow stronger, more intricate, the rocks shining, a monument.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>I am Polaris, guiding star to spirits, Cairn-Builder to humans.</p>
