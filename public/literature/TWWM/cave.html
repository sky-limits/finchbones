          <div class="div"> 

            <p>Sand kicked up behind:</p>

<p>Floating spices of crushed earth on the wind,</p>

<p>Cinnamon of dusty red rock and sugar made of pebbles and quartz and mica.</p>

<p>A rabbit&rsquo;s tail dashes around the corner, fur tipped with black at the edges.</p>

<p>
The sun dips and flattens, drips over the horizon;</p>

<p>Like a broken and cooked egg yolk.</p>

<p>The rabbit reaches with his front paws, grabbing the earth ahead of him -</p>

<p>Pulling himself forward and chasing those leftovers of sunlight.</p>

<p>
Freedom, possibility, they all existed in the light that glittered ahead,</p>

<p>And his nose twitched to the beat of his paws thrumming against the solid rock;</p>

<p>The scent of sagebrush and baking clay, as the rabbit chased the sun.</p>

<p>
It sinks, edges hazy against its own heat and the clouds that obscure it,</p>

<p>And the light is gone.</p>

<p>A honeyed glow seeps over the cliffs where the sun has disappeared,</p>

<p>Sweet against the sky.</p>

<p>
The rabbit skids to a halt;</p>

<p>Wide, shovel-like paws stopping him from careening over the canyon&rsquo;s edge like a stone.</p>

<p>He turns back, to travel home, and is greeted by the rising moon.</p>

<p>Its full, pale yellow light cascades down, battling the last remnants of the sun.</p>

<p>
And with a huff, decisively -</p>

<p>The moon beckons him forward, back into the canyon.</p>

<p>It echoes, the light trembling through, covering the red-rock canyon walls in silvered glory.</p>

<p>He follows, scampering quickly now, no longer confident in his strides.</p>

<p>
The howl of a coyote spills through the canyon,</p>

<p>Amplified, and his ears twitch toward the sound.</p>

<p>His instincts are torn in the two directions he knows he could take -</p>

<p>The way home is close at hand, a simple dash through the rock walls.</p>

<p>
The way home, where his entire family is.</p>

<p>Where the coyotes, undeniably, would pick up his scent,</p>

<p>Where the coyotes would, undeniably...</p>

<p>
A hidden niche, a quiet dimple in the rock face</p>

<p>The stone drifting away into a cave inside the canyon walls.</p>

<p>The rabbit wiggles his way in -</p>

<p>Earth patters down from the roof onto his pelt -</p>

<p>
And he is in the cave.</p>

<p>It glitters with underground starlight, the wavering, watery light of the moon reflecting inside,</p>

<p>Bouncing away from the small specks of almost glass-like quartz,</p>

<p>And seeming to summon the howls of the coyotes.</p>

<p>
They stumble upon the niche in the rock,</p>

<p>Nosing, gnashing, snarling.</p>

<p>Spittle splashes into the back of the cave, against the rabbit.</p>

<p>He crushes himself to the back wall, hoping against hope.</p>

<p>
The coyotes never leave.</p>

<p>They stay, fur warmed by the sunlight that fizzles into the cave,</p>

<p>Panting, waiting for the rabbit.</p>

<p>
It takes days before they leave.</p>

<p>It takes days before...</p>

<p>
The rabbit was not alone for long after they left. A careful footstep from a silent, gentle behemoth, unseen before, called him from a sleep which the coyotes assumed he would never wake. Where once he had been torn from his family, lost, he now awakened found.</p>
