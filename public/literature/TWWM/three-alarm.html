        <center><h1>three-alarm</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>The smell of smoke is not something I am unfamiliar with. Not only do my storms bring it to mind whenever my emotions flare, but it occurs far too often naturally. The scent itself is acrid, and it torches the back of your throat like a slithering snake, inside you, with no intention to leave. It's something I've known by heart, with the way it follows me like a demon unseen. I am possessed by the smell of smoke, not only from my own fires - the dry storms of emotions - but from random, worldly happenstance, and each time it strikes fear in my heart like lightning touching the earth.</p>

            <p>Lightning strikes fields of hay, wheat, and barley more often than you think. From a scientific standpoint - from observations I have made while out in the field, while watching the world happen around me - I would think it is from the gentle rustle of the stalks against one another, raspy whispers on the dusty wind. The static from their movements must be absorbed up into the sky; to strike them down with envy at their ever chattering seed heads.</p>
            
            <p>When it does come down back to the earth, it scorches the spot it touches onto, and leaves darkness upon the ground, blackening stalks and leaving nothing in its wake. This may not be the first thought that comes to mind when conflict happens - but this is one of the conflicts of my biome. The conflict of fire upon unwilling grasses and parts of my world, where it brings me running.</p>
            
            <p>I follow the smell whenever it calls to me. From the world I see over, with my back turned to the source, I smell the smoke before I see it, and before the fire, I see the smoke. When I arrive at the scene of the vindictive lightning, pillars of white smoke billow up to the sky above, turned grey and dark from the burning material. The white smoke means everything is still burning - and this time, when I arrive at the first pillar of white smoke, I lose my footing.</p>
            
            <p>The fire rages among grass and brush that I know house animals, and my entire body trembles. This is something I have hated for my entire existence, destruction I cannot stop, cannot keep from happening. My own destruction - that I can take away from the world of animals and humans, if I think enough to run fast away before the dry storms strike - but this? This I am powerless to stop, this I am powerless to prevent. I cannot face this conflict head on like a difficult windstorm, and I can do nothing but shelter survivors, become a black pillar of a burnt-out fire for them, house them in safety for all that I have.</p>
            
            <p>I can hear them, innocent little creatures, calling from rushes grown above old root hollows and soil, the survivors of this fire. Electricity flares up my mane, crackles along the horn that glows on my head, a SOS symbol to the animals in the grasses. I am terrified of this blaze as it spreads and grows, eating up the land like a cavernous, ravenous predator, one my instincts beg me to run from, that the animal fear coursing through me begs me to flee from.</p>
            
            <p>I can't. I can't run this time, can't leave behind how this makes me feel. I dash into the whipping flames, feather-light steps carrying me across scorched earth that cracks and crumbles without the weight of my body. I herd field mice and rabbits, quail and rats, helping them to escape from the destruction. I can barely face the fire as the flames lick across my body harmlessly, for though I cannot feel the heat I can still feel the fear of it, the terror of being caught within it even though the embers would never be able to touch me.</p>
            
            <p>I turn to the animals I have saved, waving my mane as my tail snaps and sparks with static electricity, cautioning them away from the massacre of the grass in front of them, and I face the fire after I have seen them away safely. How do I make myself go back in? Check for more survivors? I feel guilt bubbling in the pit of my belly, that I can't stop the fire, and all I can do is wait until it rages down and stops. There is so much grief in the smell of fire smoke, so much hurt. That is what motivates me to go back to into the flame, to seek out more. The fire this time has caught from a home, from a structure built in the plains long ago and since then abandoned. There are none of the two-legged humans here, at least not anymore, and as I shoulder my way through curtains of fire, I find nothing else.</p>
            
            <p>All I feel from the flames is warmth, and I stand cloaked in them, watching the world around me through their amber color. At least, this time, I did not stand by the sidelines.</p> </div>
