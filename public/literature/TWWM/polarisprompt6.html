            <p>This house was calm as it had been when I was&#8230;before. It was still old, crumbling, endlessly sinking into the ground, but it remained my home. I was fueled by anger, grief, I mourned for my life before. I had been too changed; I was too different from before. Something had broken me, hurt me, and I was gone, or at least something in me was gone. I had resigned myself to my fate, however, and channeled by anger into something new.</p>

            <p>The lantern I held contained light, a small flower in it that glowed. It called moths, birds, bugs to it, sending out some summoning signal that told me it had a use. The lantern proved itself to me one night, when the stars sung their way through the skies, and the ocean lapped gently at the shore. I was sitting inside my home, cradling gently the blanket my loved one had made. What was her name again? I don&rsquo;t quite remember, but she reminded me of wild dances in the woods, wolves howling, flowing riverbeds, and flowering tree buds. I frowned to myself &ndash; all I could remember was her face, framed by brilliant coppery hair, and her smile, how kind it was.</p>
            
            <p>But the memory was shaken from my bones when a gentle whirl swept up the leaves in my entryway, twirling them into a cyclone of sputtering, rotting plant material. Then it dropped, suddenly, and a crackling entered my mind. Sparking, hot anger filled my veins, and I was nearly blinded from it. It was another presence, in my home, called by my light &ndash; I knew it instinctively. The feeling was trying to communicate, trying to talk to me, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp what it was saying. Instead, I sat with the feeling, allowing it to roll over me, and focused on channeling it into something different.</p>
            
            <p>This spirit was angry about being left behind, frustrated, unable to communicate with me. I calmed myself, and allowed myself to feel, combat what the spirit had going on. I felt acceptance, pushed this feeling outwards, where it trembled like a newly plucked string on a harp. The vibration of my attempt at healing was snatched by the angry spirit, and it seemed to breathe out, softening, and dissipating.</p>
            
            <p>I was alone once again in my home, and the light of my lantern brightened. I felt lighter, happier, like I had helped somehow? Like I had healed so many times as I had done before. A kindred spirit, simply looking for the light of a way out. The experience pulled me back in time, to my life before, where I hovered over a small girl, sitting on my kitchen table. Her leg bent at a painful junction, covered in bloodied scrapes and bruises. I set it as gently as I could, and her pain subsided. Like the broken bones, sicknesses, fevers, and aches I had cured in my past life, I now engineered new cures for the spirits broken by their deaths and what they had collected from the past.</p>
            
            <p>Like trailing mists, more and more spirits came to my home. Some, like the first, were angry, vengeful, frightening. It took everything in me to quell them, bring them back to peace. Some spirits, fluttering like beating moth wings, simply drowsed outside, sleepy tendrils of fog tethering them to the earth. This was when I learned I could only heal those who wanted to be healed. Still, the mourning I felt for the life that I had held so dear allowed me to connect with these strangers, who needed my help. The anger I felt at my creator &ndash; that bright blue glow that with no warning had stolen me from what was to be a restful sleep with my beloved &ndash; taught me how to relate with those spirits who felt such rightful animosity towards their abusers, their murderers. I calmed their griefs, salved their wounds, sat with them in front of my empty, cold, fireplace, saying nothing.</p>
            
            <p>They were never able to speak to me, never able to show me how they felt in more than a small hum of appreciation when I had helped, or their sweeping waves of emotion when they first entered the spaces of my home. There was one, a woman I suppose, who crashed into me, one late night as I patrolled the shores, pleased at the sounds of the waves and how they gently stroked the sand, swallowing shells, and spitting them back out. A howl beckoned from the woods, and I looked towards the sound, which was when the spirit tumbled past, caught by the hum of my energy. She wept, the grief pouring from her soul until I stumbled, fell to my knees. She was alone, searching for someone she knew, and I knew I could help.</p>
            
            <p>I too, had searched looking for the red-haired love of my life. I knew I had been changed into this form for a reason, and so I soothed the wounds of the woman. Maybe this was my purpose now, to continue my healing as I had before, an endless cycle of becoming myself, in newer and newer forms every time.</p>
