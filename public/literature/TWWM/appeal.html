            <p>noun</p>
            
            <p>the action of approving something.</p>
            
            <p>Yes, I seek approval. I seek approval for what I am, though I cannot change it. I seek approval for my beat upon this world; an unsteady thrum of undercurrent drums, to be accepted, pardoned for my crimes. Approval is more than the words of thanks or murmured love, though.</p>
            
            <p>Approval would mean I would be welcomed where others are; wanted in their presence to observe, to help, to study, to heal. I would allow myself around the company of the animals and esks in my biome more often, if only I knew that I could keep them safe and protected from the lightning I possess.</p>
            
            <p>It is a difficult thing to know inherently that my emotions have the ability to harm more than regular ones, more than words, my emotions and the pain they bring are physical. I can bring a blight upon the earth where my lightning strikes - where I feel too harshly, I cause pain.</p>
            
            <p>If I cast my eyes elsewhere, to the parts of my world where I am accepted, I can understand why they approve of me. I can understand why The Seventh, an enigma who speaks only in harsh songs, could approve of my harsh emotions and how I cannot control them, as The Seventh cannot control the songs. I wonder if it is smart of me to seek approval wherever I go.</p>
            
            <p>Do I need to approve of myself first, or simply just respect myself? I think, looking deeper into it with a scientist's eye, I must first approve of myself before striving to gain the approval of others.</p> </div>
