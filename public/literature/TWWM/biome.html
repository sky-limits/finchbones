          <div class="div"> <p>The ocean is a place of change; it is the only part of the world that changes daily. Sprouts may grow, unseen, until a picture is taken every moment of their growth, documented. But the sea changes with every moment, her breath filling the world with air, and salty mist.</p>

            <p>I have been with the ocean for my entire existence, though she was here before me. She is my love, my home, my playground and my resting place - but she has changed, and some of these have been unforgiveable.</p>
            
            <p>At first, she was warm to me, and the small creatures that floated in her. Plankton, sea lilies, grasses and little fish. Nothing much was in the waters besides I and them; and this was the way I liked it. Then the ocean grew, she expanded and breathed in, her lungs working. Suddenly there were fish, eels, small yellow animals with funny snouts; and it was beautiful.</p>
            
            <p>There were so many others now to play with, to show the wonders of the sea I had shared alone. I had been overjoyed at this part, but things took a turn for the worse when humans came. They were not always bad; not always creatures of destruction and harm to the only home they have; but for long enough they have been that way, and I grieve for what the ocean has lost.</p>
            
            <p>The humans used to be simple creatures, believing in simple things. They were frightened of the ocean, of lighting and of thunder and fire - all things they take for granted now. The ocean was something to feed them, to give them life. Her veins spanning the world were a drinking source, for them, their creatures, their crops.</p>
            
            <p>Now the ocean is all but forgotten. She is a dumping ground for their trash, for their waste. Her beautiful coral, strings of it draped along the reefs of her shoulders, are poisoned by the substances they use to protect their skin.</p>
            
            <p>I miss the way the ocean used to be. Sometimes I leave her waters, to stand on the shores and look at my wild home. Every lap of her waves upon forgotten shores brings another plastic item; another fish, another fallen creature of hers.</p>
            
            <p>There are patches within her where nothing exists but trash; and slick coats of oil pour from boats and tankers, poisoning everything she is.</p>
            
            <p>My home, my love, my bed, the realm I watch over. Every day that the humans poison her is a day I spend in mourning, wishing I could close my eyes like they do, to blind myself of the harm they've done. All I can do now is to cheer the creatures and esks of my realm. The moon brings a special joy, and during these full nights where the light beams down bright into the water, I feel like I can finally breathe again.</p>
            
            <p>I dance and twirl with the sharks and the whales; esk swish their long, webbed feet with the dolphin and the deep sea jellies. This is when the ocean feels more like my home than ever, when I feel some life breathe back into her, when the weight lifts from her.</p>
            
            <p>Many poets and artists have personified the ocean, but I know who she truly is. She is an untamed creature with a heart of gold, with seaweed and kelp floating through her currents like wind through hair. She is not something you can cage, keep, or own - I call her my own in the way that I am equally hers; and I feel every wound the world inflicts upon her. On nights where the hurt is too great between us, I simply flow through the currents she provides. I cannot change what has already been done; the ocean in and of herself is a great animal, with fang and claw, and she can defend herself.</p>
            
            <p>My job is to care for the creatures - and I care for them with parties. I care for them with fun, with swimming with them. I show them all the wonderous parts of our ocean, all of the caves, the places where light does not exist. I show them the kelp, growing in such thick forests that you could get lost.</p>
            
            <p>The changes here in the ocean that houses us are a private mourning point, but one I do not allow myself to be preoccupied by permanently. I'd rather create fun, laughter, and joy under the ocean; whether the waves are roiling with storms or calm with summer, I am here to bring what could otherwise be sorely missed to the home I live in: fun, joy - freedom to have fun, to create laughter among others.</p>
            
            <p>I may be the protector of fun in this realm, but that does not mean I am blind to what goes on in it - I simply can do nothing.</p> </div>
