        <center><h1>making up</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>I have hurt many in my time as an esk, as a Wanderer of these plains. I wish I knew what caused me to so easily hurt others - to cause and inflict pain, like I meant it, even though I don't. I have never someone who wants to hurt others, who desires to cause pain. I look out across seas of waving barley, and consider my own thoughts.</p>

            <p>Am I telling myself the truth? Am I being honest? Do I truly not wish to hurt others, or am I hiding my own truth from myself - am I cruel, unkind, do I seek to hurt? I don't know for certain anymore, and I feel stuck in my own head.</p>
            
            <p>I shake my mane out, static following up the strands of hair, and my horn glows ever-so-slightly. Why do I doubt myself so? Why am I so unkind to myself, in everything that I am? I know that I do not seek to hurt, but I do, whenever I get into my own emotions. Then the stormclouds gather around my head and body, and echo all across and around the fields. Dry storms can crackle for miles around when my own self-hatred takes off, and I hate it.</p>
            
            <p>I hate that my own emotions - my own thoughts, and feelings, and inner conflicts - can hurt others so. My anger and depression is physical for the animals and humans I have hurt, and I regret it dearly.</p>
            
            <p>The sun is setting, now. It distracts me and pulls me from my spiral, and I turn to watch it. I owe the world something back for what I have done to it, I think. The setting sun casts an orange and gold glow onto the world, making the mountains throw blue shadows onto the grass. In the echo of one of the shadows, I squint at an unclear shape. Piles of...something...lie stacked on top of each other and in scraps of rubbish. I wonder what it is, and casting my gaze one last time back at the sunset, I decide to follow my inner scientist desires, and go to it.</p>
            
            <p>Running across the plains is the one time I feel so very free - I feel like I truly understand the desires and motivations of the animals that live on my plains. The simple act of motion across the grasses and the powdery ground is what keeps the animals alive, the simple joy of just moving and being. It is the one time I feel I can truly let go of all of the emotions that hold me back, the one time that I do not think or feel - I am just another being, another animal, running across the plains and going somewhere and nowhere, running just to survive.</p>
            
            <p>But soon, my sprint is over. I have arrived at the unfamiliar pile of strange items, and I stare at it quizzically. I'm not quite sure what it is for. There are pieces of trees, without bark and cut into long rectangles - ropes, pieces of long glass - all of it a mystery to me. But if there is one thing I understand about these materials, it is that they are human.</p>
            
            <p>The humans construct with these items all the time on my plains, building houses. I have destroyed...a great many of these houses. I bow my head in regret with the memory, and then consider carefully again the materials. Perhaps I could give back...atone...perhaps I could help instead of hurt?</p>
            
            <p>The pile waits invitingly, and I step forward. I nudge the blocks of wood against a rock, and then carefully move other pieces around. I step back to consider my organization, and confidently nod. I can do this - I have seen the humans do it many times, and I know their processes.</p>
            
            <p>It takes me a large portion of the day, from when the sun has risen with my run across the fields, to the high noontime heat, and all the way to the time when the sun caresses the horizon and falls beneath it. With the last remaining light of the day, I am able to look at my hard work.</p>
            
            <p>I am covered in dirt and grime, and I shake my fur out while I consider the structure. It stands taller than normal structures do, and is a bit lopsided, but I suppose it shall work. I leaned the beams against one another and piled others between them to complete the gaps, filling it in gently with the glass I found lying on the ground. There were small, hard rocks - bricks, I think - that I used to top everything, floating slightly above the ground to pile them on top of the house I had built. It may not be perfect - it is certainly not what the humans would expect, but I hope it makes up for some of the damage I have done.</p> </div>
