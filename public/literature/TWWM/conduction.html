        <center><h1>conduction</h1></center>
       
          <div class="div"> <p>Vetru was walking the plains and following along harvest mouse trails, where their little herds of creatures had run by, through the wild grasses and tall chicory plants. They love their home, but recently - all too recently - they've been missing the company of others. The plains are a lonely place, when you do not know who else to find. When there is no one else around, when you are alone. They have been alone for much of their life, chasing away others with the dry storm that follows them in emotions, crackling through their fur and bringing static that stands their fur straight up.</p>

            <p>They look across the plains, long, thick tail swishing like reedgrass in the gales that sweep the prairie. Perhaps a visit is in order, or a hide-and-seek game of some sort, where Vetru will try to find another Wanderer, or at the very least, another esk who would not run away. They cast their eyes to the mountains that crest at the edges of the plains, and think about traveling there, trying to get into the Conservatory, to see their mother.</p>
            
            <p>No, perhaps not. To the mountains themselves then, to see the fearsome Raaga? No. The oceans, the kingdoms of humans, the cold, wintery north, the desert with her shifting elemental and smokey magics, the tall copses of trees? No. Vetru blew out a breath, exhaling not from nostrils or a mouth, but from the winds of their elemental that whipped up at the growing frustration.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps to another, to the freshwater biome, to the sibling that did not speak in clear words - the Seventh. Yes, Vetru nodded. Yes, that would be the place to go to. They turned their head to the forest that housed a river at the edge of the plains boundary, stood from their position on their haunches - shaking off the settled dust of the prairie - and set off.</p>
            
            <p>The river was not so far as to be difficult to get to, but Vetru walked slowly, methodically, thinking as they strode across, feeling the long grasses brush the bottom of their belly. Would the Seventh be there, sitting in the river? Would Vetru have to find the Seventh? It would be a puzzle, for sure, but one that Vetru would solve, for the sake of family and familiarity with someone whom Vetru identified.</p>
            
            <p>The trees of the forest brushed the sky gently, leaves shaking in the wind that seemed to always follow Vetru. Spring grasses grew underneath their paws, springing up and through the leaves of the autumn. The river lay ahead, the sound of the roaring white waters echoing through the forest, bouncing off of the trees and to where Vetru stood, at the edge of the forest itself.</p>
            
            <p>Rocks at the edge of the river glowed, illumed by the light of the Seventh. The Seventh was already here, already standing - twiggy legs unmoving against the roaring force of the waters - at the bank, staring up at Vetru. Vetru took a moment to reconsider. The comfort, companionship, and company of someone they knew, someone they felt in sync with; the feeling of being outcast, feared, of not embodying who you wish to be. But then there was also the regret, and the hatred, and the bitter, bitter feeling that the Seventh had never helped when Vetru had caused a mess to occur. When their lightning struck the plains, when brush was set aflame by their dry storms, no one came to help.</p>
            
            <p>Vetru shook their head. Who were they to blame the Seventh for what was, intrinsically, their fault? They stepped down the slight hillock to the riverbank, where sandy shores gave way to pebbled shallows, and finally, to the rapid whitewater where the Seventh stood, silent, for once.</p>
            
            <p>In Vetru's scientific mind, they wished to study the Seventh. Why were they one of the outliers of their Mother's children? Vetru tilted their head, and sat down once again on their haunches. The Seventh copied them, bending stick-like legs that were so fragile they could've snapped, if not for the unreal form of the entity. The Seventh settled down on top of the water's surface, like a blackened dandelion seed, fur swirling slightly in the currents. &quot;Hello.&quot; Vetru started, unsure. &quot;You've come to me again.&quot;</p>
            
            <p>The Seventh warbles, a high, mosquito-pitched hum. The song means nothing to Vetru, but they nod as if it does. &quot;What is it that draws you to me, sibling?&quot; The song of the Seventh takes on a more curious warble in reply, like that of a whip-poor-will, or a mourning dove. &quot;Electricity and water do not mix well,&quot; Vetru comments, sadly. They stare into the eyes of the Seventh, hoping to communicate their point, hoping to get through somehow. &quot;Is that it? Is that why you seek me out so?&quot; The Seventh makes no noise - just holds Vetru's gaze, without comment.</p> </div>
