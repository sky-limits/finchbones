        <p>I think it has been a wild ride of a year so far. Dogs....jobs....college (and dropping out of it!) I haven't had time to touch my website in about 10 months, and I feel like my views on it are changing.
Do I still want to host all my art on here? yes....but there's so much of it. All of my characters? I wish, but there are also. so many. So the site will probably be cleaned up over the following days, removing my old work and speeding up the site itself.
Adding more shrines, pictures of things I love, etc. 

        </p>

        <p>In other news, almost a year with my boyfriend! Love him dearly - we're planning a nice trip :). I'll be moving out soon, and somewhere else, so hopefully I'd be able to write more?
          I do miss it.
