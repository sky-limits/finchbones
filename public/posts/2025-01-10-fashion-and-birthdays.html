      <p>Today is my brother's birthday! Happy birthday bud. I hope it's a good day - you deserve a good year.</p>

      <p>The second matter: fashion.
        <br>
        Especially fast fashion - it's too prevalent in our world nowadays. Clothes last for, what, 2 years if you're lucky? 3 if you're delicate with them like they're fine china? It's another 
        thing that I think is bullshit, and that I work to change. All of my clothes? Old as hell. I haven't bought new clothes in a long while. "But Finch," you say, "What happens when they get dirty? Or have holes?" 
        Well, dear reader: first of all. You can wash clothes. Second of all, I fix and make my own clothes! This will be sort of a primer on that.
      </p>

      <b>The Idea</b>
      <p>I have a pattern for quite a nice dress: princess seams, sleeveless. I custom fit it to me, so I know it will fit; the hardest part is just cutting straight lines on the fabric!
        <br>
        Anyway - I made mine for a 44 1/2" bust, 41" waist, and 47" hip. This all in all leads me to only need four yards of fabric - which you can find for excellently cheap prices. The cost of making this whole dress comes out to about $28. That's it! 
        And it's only sewing together 4 pieces of fabric for a dress I know will fit me!
