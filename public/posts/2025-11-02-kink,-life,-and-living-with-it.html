     <p>What an awful intro. lmao.
      <br><br>
      Anyway, to the real point of the post: Let's talk about kink! Specfically, mine, and how it influences my everyday life. Personally, I am a submissive first and foremost. It is the easiest thing for me to slip
      into and embody with respect to the mental state it requires. I love being in subspace! However, if asked, I categorize myself more as a switch - I can take on the dominant role if required or asked to by a partner.
      It's alright - not my favorite thing in the entire world, but truly what I like about it is having that small ounce of control over someone else. Knowing I can say jump and they'll ask how high.
      <br>
      <br>
      But in regards to arousal, it really doesn't do much for me. I think it is a complex and strange sort of dynamic in my mind, where I can take on both so easily, but what really interests me is how it is just my life in general.
      <br>
      <br>
      I think that kink can have a place in everyday life. It's true that you shouldn't wear extreme fetish gear to the office, but is it a cardinal sin to wear a day collar? To call your partner "puppy" in public under your breath?
      There are extremes to any sort of situation, and kink, BDSM, and other forms of play are not exempt. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Kink takes up quite a large part of my life outside of work and public places. To me, it is one of the simplest ways to think and to be. However, it can be...difficult to get comfortable with it.
      For me, it is an extension of my body and my mind. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If I am subbing, I put myself into the hands of the person I am playing with, and that is no light matter. It can be so freeing though, shutting off your thoughts and becoming 
      easy to talk to, easy to maniupulate, and it lifts stress, fear, and anxiety from me when done right. This cannot be a one-way street though, especially when it comes to being a service sub.
       All I want is to make the other person I'm playing with happy, satisfied, anything they want. When done correctly, I feel no anxiety about doing this for them. I am reassured, I know they are happy, the scene is complete.
       <br>
       <br>
       Being a domme, for me, is particularly different. It CAN be more stressful, and a person you click with well in order to build that dynamic with is VERY important. As a domme, I worry constantly about the physical and mental 
       safety of my sub. These things are my responsibility in that moment (and in the comedown). I don't know if I'm good at it (but I haven't heard any complaints thus far), but I hope I can continue improving.
