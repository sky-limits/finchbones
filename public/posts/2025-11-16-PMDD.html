      <h1>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I think a lot of people misconstrue what exactly goes on in the body of someone who deals with PMDD. I think a large portion of it has to do with the fact that it differs so greatly
        from person to person, and even more with the fact that no one ever tells you when what you're feeling is abnormal.

      <p>For me, I thought there was just...something weak inside of me. Of course I'm emotional before my period, that's the sterotype, that's what everyone goes through, right? 
        Everyone else who gets a period feels like they want to kill themselves a couple days before it starts...right? They feel that heaviness in their chests and palms and stomach, a weight dooming them 
        to an eternity (or fifty years, give or take) of agony? Everyone else must just be stronger than me, better than me, more able to cope with it than me. I am the weak link, I am the problem, I am 
        suffering whilst they're all just...a little irritable.
      </p>

      <p>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder - the villain, the curse, what keeps me from being myself - is something that I have lived with for nine years. 
        It instills so much fear in me.
        I already deal with depression, what if I were to have a child? Would the combination of post-partum and regular depression, combined with PMDD, finally kill me? There's no way to know. 
        I am already doing everything I can to treat it, what else is left? Nothing besides a total removal of my hormone-producing organs. I am so lost.

      <p>When it came to be in full swing, the worst it ever was, I was in tenth grade and had just started dating my now-ex girlfriend. I was.......suffice it to say, PMDD makes you feel like 
        two different people. You spend the other two weeks of your cycle recovering from being something you hate. I wanted to be anything but that. I dealt with such severe depression, but killing myself 
        - an extreme option, but really, where else can you go after the medical community can no longer help you - was not an option.
        <br>
        <br>
        What do you do when you can't escape a situation, something so tied to who you are as a person - you can never escape your own body, good fucking luck! - that it drags you into the depths? 
        Well, of course, you become someone else. Maybe I'll regret saying this here, but it doesn't really matter to me anymore, and I have to get it out. Being up too late, thinking too long, filled with ideas, 
        a tick swollen on the blood of ideas...it's not good for you.

      <p>For twoish years - tenth grade to twelfth - I went by he/him pronouns, and the name Elliot. Only online, and hell I could never mention it to my ex, when I brought it up as if a "friend" had done it 
        she looked at me like shit scraped off her shoe. So I lived my little online, closeted life, playing at being someone else. Someone confident, someone who didn't hurt all the time, someone who took the pain and 
        accepted it because there was no other choice left for him. I thinkk it saved my life more than anything else I ever did.
      </p>

      <p>Those last two years of highschool were rough. My relationship was bad, I had about...half a friend in real life, doing dual-enrollment for a college I hated the idea of, that identity 
        gave me somewhere to escape to. I suppose this is less of a post about PMDD now and more about gender confusion but...still. For a few hours each day, online, people called me by a different name. 
        That was powerful enough for me to forget my life outside of the computer, my writing, the world I created in my head whilst being so isolated.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        I think I started to let go of Elliot around the time my ex moved away for college. I no longer had as many people who wanted to see me. I spent even less time online. Coming out of highschool, I wanted 
        that new, fresh start. I wanted to be me again, Finch (of course not my real name, hah! just pretend I used my real name if you know me irl). I wanted to take the skills I learned from years of playing pretend 
        at loving myself and put it towards my <i>actual</i> self. It worked a lot better than I thought. I only wish I understood the dynamics behind it, why it helped me so much.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't think I'll ever know. I don't think I know how to explain it to others in my life now either; but then again, is it really something to explain further than I have? Besides, 
        people in my life already know I deal with other sorts of mental issues. I'm sure hearing something like this wouldn't be much news.
