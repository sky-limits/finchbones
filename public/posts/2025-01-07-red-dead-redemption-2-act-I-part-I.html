        When we first meet Arthur, he's something of an errand boy. We recognize Abigail, Dutch -
         will they be who keeps our focus for the game?
         No. They won't.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter I: Colter</h3>

      <p>
        It's cold. Colder than anything we've ever known, and too many of our friends have died or are dying in front of us. We are powerless to stop it.
         We only know what Dutch, Hosea, somehow our superiors, tell us to do. A first little twinge of panic - discomfort? Approaches when Dutch refuses to answer about the activity
          on the boat in Blackwater.
<br>
          <i><small>"What really went down back there on that boat?" <br> "We missed you, that's what happened. Come on.</small></i>

          <br>
          We travel out into the snow, leaving the camp behind in search of our other members - and Dutch speaks to us like a son. 
          <br><i><small>"You need to help me pick the others back up. Youâ€™re the only one I can rely on to stay strong right now."</small></i><br>

          What is someone supposed to say to something like that? Nothing, perhaps. Nothing is all we get to say, with Dutch finding Micah ahead.
           But it sets the tone for the relationship between Dutch and Arthur perfectly - Arthur; the son who never gets his questions answered, too young, too dumb, too obedient to ever question. Dutch; the father with many mouths to feed, many mouths he is unwilling to listen to.
            But when he <i>needs</i> something from them, well hell, they're his favorite kid. The man of the house, the only one he can depend on.
      <br>
      Now, riding further up the trail with Micah, we hear about this party house. For any experienced player, a small wound of sadness may begin to open in your chest - Sadie Adler lies ahead, in the worst moments of her entire life.
