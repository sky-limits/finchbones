When I first started to build my website, I didn't really think too hard about the layout. Sure, it's been through a lot of changes, but at its core - I'm just now realizing - I truly made this place a home.
Not in the cheesy sense. Hell, I titled my shrine area "rooms.html". I think part of that is because my own room in real life is such a place of unease. I'm never sure what it's going to be like when I get home.
But here, on finchbones.com, my rooms will always be just the way I left them. Hard-coded to stay perfect and organized and never threatened to be taken away.
</p>

<p>Partially I wonder if it's some sort of hoarding instinct. Now, I've never had any sort of inkling of an instinct like that in real life, but I think the only way to get close
    to some of my fixations is to collect images of them. Hence, the shrines. And I know they'll never be destroyed, taken away, searched through like I'm hiding something...
