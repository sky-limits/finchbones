      <p>I think love is an odd thing. Not that it is something that should not be felt, but that it is something nearly so untouchable as to make it holy.</p>
      
      <p>When you're more animal than human, loving comes easy. Love is company, and being with the other(s) whom you love.</p>
      
      <p>When you're more animal than human, you want to chew your way out of love. You want to escape it like a leather muzzle, slowly wrapping your tongue and teeth around the crossbars and joints, gnawing away as time goes on, until the muzzle falls off. But this is how it is for a <i>caged</i> animal. This is how it is for an animal who lives to be obedient, subservient, a mechanism or tool.</p>
      
      <p>I let myself be a tool for far too long. I enjoyed the obedience, the simple knowing of what would come next as routine and marked and known. It could be peaceful. But I felt it bubbling within me, the urge to <i>"escape, bite, bite hard and fast and make yourself heard, what are you, a coward?"</i></p>
      
      <p>I chewed my leg out of the trap and freed myself.</p>
