      <h1>Therianthropy and Me</h1>
      
      <p>why do i let myself write titles like they're self help books LOL.</p>
      <p>anyway. therians. (and me!) i never called myself one until a few months ago, because i didn't feel it was warranted...or that i needed that community. however, i saw people come together over it, and decided i would like that too!</p>
      
      <p>to me, being a therian is not...hm. it's difficult to describe. i know physically that i do not have the body - and will not have the body - of any of my theriotypes. but i can feel it at times, my ears perking and flattening, my antlers heavy on my head, my tail flicking or wagging, wings stretching and flapping. it might just be a delusion of some sort; but it doesn't hurt anyone, or hurt me. so i see no issue with it or feeding into it. it makes me feel good to nestle down into my blankets at night and grumble and sigh like a dog, makes me happy to stay up at night and watch the other bats outside fly around and chirp.</p>
      
      <p>it is weird to be surrounded by others with other views - just because i cant get past my own mental roadblocks, not that their views are bad at all! - and sometimes im bad at interacting with them, but im doing my best i think :).</p>
